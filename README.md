# Feedback System
* I developed a College Feedback System where students can submit feedback through MCQ-based evaluations. The system automatically calculates scores and generates insights for faculty performance. Access is role-restricted, so HODs, faculty, and students each have their own dashboard and permissions.

#  Key Highlights:
* MCQ Feedback Forms
* Automated Scoring
* Role-based Dashboards
* Reports & Analytics
